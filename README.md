# vitepress-payload-extractor

Extracting duplicate payloads of meta information after vitepress wrapping

## Motivation

Our team was using [vitepress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) to build
large project documents, but as the number of documents grew, the meta
information payload of html pages became oversized, so I made this tool that
extracts the duplicate payload of pages and reduces the size of the package.

With it, our team's production documents went from `255MB` to `94.4MB`, which is
`37%` of the original size. If you are in the same dilemma, maybe you can try
this tool!

## Usage

### install

```shell
npm i vitepress-payload-extractor -D
```

### Configuration

Introduce the package in your `vitepress` configuration file

#### payloadExtraction

在 `vitepress` 打包过程中提取重复的元信息有效载荷

```ts
// .vitepress/config.js
import { defineConfig } from "vitepress";
import { payloadExtraction } from "vitepress-payload-extractor";

export default defineConfig({
  transformHtml(code, _, ctx) {
    return payloadExtraction(code, ctx.siteConfig.outDir);
  },
});
```

<br />

#### minifyHtml

Compresses html and is compatible with vitepress

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vitepress";
import { minifyHtml } from "vitepress-payload-extractor";

export default defineConfig({
  transformHtml(code) {
    return minifyHtml(code);
  },
});
```
